Movement struct has two methods, rotate_object and move_object.

move_object takes the object and a positional vector, a speed, and the latest delta time. This will modify the model matrix which changes the objects position while maintaining it's shape.

rotate_object add's the specified amount of radians (can be negative) to the object by modifying the model matrix.
