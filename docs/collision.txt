Currently the "check_collisions" function takes 1 object and checks if it is colliding with any other object in the current master list.
collision is only detected if the called object has the same collision type as the other object, AND meets that collision types requirements.

I'll probably write better functions for this later but it is functional.

That being said, because the developer has direct access to the object data, you could write your own collision types if the premades are not satisfactory.


Premade collision types:
AABB
Circle
OBB (unfinished)
